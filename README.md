## Detailed Explanation of the Idea

The current pandemic has affected the education system all over the world. Everyone is learning remotely. We all know about the impact of COVID-19 and how it has presented an unprecedented challenge to the education system. It is still all right for the senior students but the junior students are the ones who need regular interaction and our current education system is not able to provide this to them. Interactive AR learning can have a significant positive impact on students. It keeps them engaged throughout the lesson and makes learning fun and effortless.
 
 
## Solution provided

We created An AR-based website EduAR where students from any background can visit the site and learn various concepts with the help of 3D Models, which makes learning easier. EduAR can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter. A picture is worth a thousand words, right? So, instead of reading theory about something, students can interact with it. We also created a chatbot and multi-language support in our website which makes it even more convenient for students to learn.
